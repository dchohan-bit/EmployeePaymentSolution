Employee payment service is a ASP.NET web application that uses a database to keep records of employees and how they are paid. Payments are done by users who are registered in the system. There are two types of users, normal users and administrators. Normal users can add employees who can be paid while administrators can do all actions in the application including managing other users.
During the payments, there is calculation of taxes which is done by an API. The tax is 10% of the amount. To calculate the tax, the API is called and the amount is passed. The API returns the total tax after calculation. All the methods in the API service have been tested using the Arrange Act Assert method.
In the main application, logging to a text file is done for all major actions such that every time an action is performed a log is appended in the log file.
